# Calculator

This project is a very simple calculator. The only thing I really wanted to do is make a calculator to see if I was understanding the ruby language better.

## Getting Started

If you want to run this you will have to have ruby installed at the moment and download the .rb file. Pull the file up in comand and then run ruby calc.rb. Once you do that you will be asked a few questions answer them and it will give you an answer.
